      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good Bluetooth speaker for a while now. My old one, a 1st gen Anker SoundCore that I bought in late in 2018 decided to quit working on me 2020 when the battery failed. I decided that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want another one that would only last me a year or two before it failed. The ones that have actually decent sound just cost too much for me to be able to justify that. That one requirement turned out to be a big problem as almost nobody makes a decent Bluetooth speaker with a replaceable battery. Except, the power tool makers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So Nextcloud got the ability awhile back to make use of LLMs for various things, like speech to text, text summerization and image generation. Sounded like a handy addon, and it turns out I had the hardware needed to self host it, kinda. Turns out there are some limitations, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing I needed to do was figure out how to run the LLM and a quick search turned up a couple of different options. The most obvious one for me to try was Ollama as it is in the Nix repos. Installing it was pretty simple, just add the following to the configuration.nix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Changing a Tail, Reverse or Rear Turn Signal Bulb on a 2016 Nissan Altima</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I had a taillight bulb go out on me this week, and changing that bulb was simple enough, but also not particularly obvious. Had to look it up&#xA;and could only find a overly long winded youtube video on it. In the interest of saving some one else the headache of scrubbing through a 20 min&#xA;video to get answer that could have been explained in 2 minute short, I figured I would write it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Dehumidifier Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I live in the American South and because we recently had our water&#xA;plumbing explode, the humidity in our house tends to be sky high. Like 60%&#xA;or higher high. To counter this I picked up a large dehumidifier from&#xA;Amazon which has largely worked well controlling the humidity until&#xA;recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently though I noticed that the humidifier kept turning off and on.&#xA;Dehumidifier was set to 35 but the household thermostat was reading 55%&#xA;humidity. As a check, I set the dehumidifier to run continuously. It&#xA;stayed running and the humidity in the house started dropping and is&#xA;down to the 30â€™s in the room where the device is located and down to&#xA;46 at the thermostat. My conclusion was that the humidity sensor on the&#xA;device had failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, Here I am. Once again. Building a new website for myself that I will surely abandon within a week. At least this one is a static site built on Hugo so perhaps this one will survive system updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
