<h3 id="tools-and-parts-list">Tools and Parts list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flat head screwdriver</li>
<li>8mm deepwell socket or wrench (A standard socket might work, but a baby socket won&rsquo;t. Long bolts.)</li>
<li>Replacement bulb
<ul>
<li>The red brake and taillight bulb is a <a href="https://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/sylvania-7443-long-life-mini-bulb-standard-performance-2-pack-7443llbp2/5080162-P">white 7443 bulb</a>. )</li>
<li>The turn signal bulb is an amber <a href="https://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/sylvania-7440a-long-life-amber-mini-bulb-standard-performance-2-pack-7440allbp2/99997964-P?searchTerm=rear+turn+signal+bulb">7440A</a></li>
<li>The reverse light is a <a href="https://shop.advanceautoparts.com/p/sylvania-921-long-life-mini-bulb-standard-performance-2-pack-921llbp2/5080584-P?searchTerm=back-up+and+reverse+light+bulb">921</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>
<p>1.) Open the trunk. (Yes, I&rsquo;m a smart ass :-D )<br>
2.) On the rear (driver&rsquo;s perspective) corner of the trunk on the side with the blown bulb, look for a removable plastic rivet. Place under
the center part of the rivet, a flathead screwdriver and lever the center part up, then pull the rivet out. <strong>If you try to remove the
rivet before poping the center part up you will break the rivet.</strong><br>
3.) Pull the carpet to the side to reveal where the back of the tail light assembly should be. You will find  2 long bolts secured with 8mm
nuts.<br>
4.) Remove the 8mm nuts.<br>
5.) Applying rearward pressure to the exposed bolts and the outside of the assembly, remove the assembly. It slides off to the rear, not the
side. This will take a bit for force, but not much. Be careful not to damage the tail light assembly or damage the wiring harness. The
wiring harness has roughly 8 inches of play.<br>
6.) You now have access to the bulb holders for the tail/brake light, turn signal, and reverse light. The bulb holders twist loose and it
shouldn&rsquo;t take much force. The bulbs themselves are a friction fit into the bulb holders.<br>
7.) Reverse these steps to reassemble.</p>
