      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I live in the American South and because we recently had our water&#xA;plumbing explode, the humidity in our house tends to be sky high. Like 60%&#xA;or higher high. To counter this I picked up a large dehumidifier from&#xA;Amazon which has largely worked well controlling the humidity until&#xA;recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently though I noticed that the humidifier kept turning off and on.&#xA;Dehumidifier was set to 35 but the household thermostat was reading 55%&#xA;humidity. As a check, I set the dehumidifier to run continuously. It&#xA;stayed running and the humidity in the house started dropping and is&#xA;down to the 30â€™s in the room where the device is located and down to&#xA;46 at the thermostat. My conclusion was that the humidity sensor on the&#xA;device had failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
