      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a perfectly good setup for hosting this largely ignored blog, so why in the name of all that&amp;rsquo;s holy would I want to change it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on moving soon which means that this site, along with all of my self hosted services are likely to be down for some time.&#xA;That may be fine for most things (Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Forgejo, etc), but this is my &amp;ldquo;Source of Truth&amp;rdquo; for how I want people to contact me. It kinda needs to stay up, and Github Pages seems to be the modern day version of a Geocity site.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s free hosting so it seems like as decent a choice as any.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
