      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I had a taillight bulb go out on me this week, and changing that bulb was simple enough, but also not particularly obvious. Had to look it up&#xA;and could only find a overly long winded youtube video on it. In the interest of saving some one else the headache of scrubbing through a 20 min&#xA;video to get answer that could have been explained in 2 minute short, I figured I would write it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
