Well, the website is up. Mastodon is linked. Matrix... Not so much. If anyone is interested I can be found here: <matrix://@paul:astaluk.icu>

On second thought, I figured it out.

It turns out that the Matrix Foundation runs a url shortener (sort of) service that allows web browsers to understand matrix addresses. Nice.

Their page is located at <https://matrix.to> and once there all you have to do is enter you user or room id and they will give you a link.
