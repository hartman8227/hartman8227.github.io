Because I live in the American South and because we recently had our water
plumbing explode, the humidity in our house tends to be sky high. Like 60%
or higher high. To counter this I picked up a large dehumidifier from 
Amazon which has largely worked well controlling the humidity until 
recently.

Recently though I noticed that the humidifier kept turning off and on. 
Dehumidifier was set to 35 but the household thermostat was reading 55% 
humidity. As a check, I set the dehumidifier to run continuously. It 
stayed running and the humidity in the house started dropping and is 
down to the 30â€™s in the room where the device is located and down to 
46 at the thermostat. My conclusion was that the humidity sensor on the 
device had failed.

I could go the hard route. Take apart the dehumidifier, try to find the 
problem and do a board level repair. Go the expensive route and replace 
a generally functioning dehumidifier. Or I could take cheap, simple, and 
admitedly jerry-rigged option. Home Assistant.

My first idea was to use Node-Red to kitbash a hygrostat together with
some basic safeties, but as I was putting the devices and sensors into 
helpers I found that Home Assistant has a new (to me anyways) helper 
called a Generic Hygostat that can connect a humidity sensor like 
[this one](<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2NVJTS3>) by Third Reality to a 
smart outlet or plug and control that outlet based on a humidity level 
you set. It can be set to control either a humidifier or dehumidifier. 
Once you've created the helper you can add the helper to your dashboard 
and it gives you thermostat like control over your de/humidifier. Pretty 
slick.
