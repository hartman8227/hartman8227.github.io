If this post actually gets posted it means that my new workflow actually works. Apparently people far smarter than I am have already figured out a better way of
hosting Hugo websites through github pages. If I am reading the [documentation](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/) correctly all I will 
have to do is write my post, commit it to the Github Pages repository and then push those changes to Github. I won't even need to run hugo build.

Yep, this post is literally just exists for me to test that theory. Here goes nothing!
